This file includes a description of the additional special tile I plan to implement.

Special Tile Name: Bounus Turn
Effect: This is a lucky turn for the player who uses it. When any other player puts a tile on this special tile, the owner of this special tile 
	will obtain an additional chance to play. This is to say, after finishing a play, the player should draw the tile and make another play
